# ColorBridge
**Turn your MX Creative Console into a Color Studio**

## Overview
ColorBridge is a Logi Actions SDK plugin concept that transforms the MX Creative Console into a complete color management workstation for designers and developers.

## Live Prototype

## The Problem
Designers and developers are constantly switching between different tools just to work with colors:
- Browser extensions for picking colors from screen
- Separate websites to check accessibility standards
- Online converters for HEX/RGB/HSL formats
- Different apps to manage color palettes

It's messy, inefficient, and breaks your workflow.

## The Solution
ColorBridge unifies the entire color workflow into one hardware device:

- **9 LCD Buttons** - Display live color swatches with HEX codes. Press to copy.
- **Main Dial** - Physical color wheel controlling Hue (0-360°)
- **Sub-Dial** - Adjust Saturation and Lightness with real-time feedback
- **Actions Ring** - 8 quick actions: Screen Picker, Format Paste, Contrast Check, Palette Generator
- **Haptic Feedback** - Feel when colors fail accessibility standards through your mouse

**Works everywhere:** Figma, Photoshop, VS Code, browsers—no app-specific plugins needed.

## Key Features

### Hardware Integration
- Physical color wheel interaction via dial
- Real-time WCAG AA/AAA contrast checking
- Multi-format clipboard output (HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK)
- Visual palette management on LCD buttons
- Auto-generate color schemes (Complementary, Analogous, Triadic)
- Universal tool that works across all applications

### Innovation
- **First hardware color tool** for Logitech ecosystem
- **Haptic accessibility feedback** - Feel compliance through your mouse
- **Dial-as-color-wheel** - Intuitive and unprecedented interaction
- **No app plugins needed** - Universal workflow

## Technical Approach

Built with **Logi Actions SDK (C#)**:
- `PluginDynamicCommand` - Button actions and color copying
- `PluginDynamicAdjustment` - Dial-based HSL controls
- Dynamic LCD image generation for real-time swatches
- Haptics API for tactile accessibility feedback
- WCAG contrast calculation algorithms
- Palette generation algorithms
- System-wide clipboard integration

## Target Audience
- UI/UX Designers managing brand colors and design systems
- Front-end Developers working with CSS and color variables
- Brand Managers ensuring accessibility compliance
- Digital Artists requiring precise color control
- Anyone who works with colors across multiple applications daily

## Development Roadmap

If selected for Semi-Finals:
1. Develop core color picker and dial integration
2. Implement dynamic LCD swatch rendering
3. Build haptic feedback system for accessibility
4. Create palette generation algorithms
5. Test across multiple operating systems and applications
6. Refine UX based on real-world testing
